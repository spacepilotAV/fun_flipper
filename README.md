# fun_flipper
general purpose character corruption tool, designed for binary &amp; binary-like file format fuzzing

use `fun_flipper.py IN_FILE OUT_FILE {#BITFLIPS}`, the `{}` are optional arguments.

if no bitflip count is specified, 1% of the characters will be flipped `(bitflip count = 1% * len(in_text))`


## DISCLAIMER
this software should work OK, but in the case it breaks and your dick shatters or you get your dick stuck in a ceiling fan or toaster, or another "funny" dick related injury, I AM NOT LIABLE! I HAVE WARNED YOU! DO NOT RUN THIS ON `/dev/sda` or `/dev/disk0` AND COME CRYING TO ME LIKE A LITTLE SHIT! IF YOU WIN A DARWIN (heh) AWARD BECAUSE OF THIS SOFTWARE IT ISN'T MY FUCKING FAULT! DO NOT COME CRYING TO ME! thanks
